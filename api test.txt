 Backend API Implementation Complete
 Architecture & Setup
NestJS backend with MongoDB database
JWT authentication with role-based access control
Mongoose schemas with geospatial indexing
Class-validator for request validation
CORS enabled for frontend integration
Modular structure with separate modules for each feature
 Authentication System
User registration with role-based signup (patient/nurse/admin)
JWT token-based authentication
Password hashing with bcryptjs
Role-based guards and decorators
Automatic nurse profile creation during registration
üìç Geolocation Features
MongoDB 2dsphere indexing for location-based queries
Nearby nurses search with radius filtering
Location coordinates stored as GeoJSON points
Distance-based sorting and filtering
 API Endpoints Implemented
Authentication (/api/auth)
POST /register - Register new users (patients/nurses/admins)
POST /login - User authentication with JWT tokens
Nurses (/api/nurses)
GET /nearby - Find nearby nurses with location and specialization filters
PATCH /:id/verify - Admin verification of nurse credentials
Requests (/api/requests)
POST / - Create service requests (patients only)
GET / - Get requests based on user role
PATCH /:id/status - Update request status (accept/complete/cancel)
Admin (/api/admin)
GET /pending-nurses - Get nurses awaiting verification

üöÄ Ready for Frontend Integration
The backend is now ready to serve the frontend pages you requested:
/register - Uses POST /api/auth/register
/login - Uses POST /api/auth/login
/dashboard - Uses GET /api/nurses/nearby
/requests - Uses POST /api/requests and GET /api/requests
/admin - Uses GET /api/admin/pending-nurses and PATCH /api/nurses/:id/verify
The backend server is currently running on http://localhost:3001 and all endpoints are functional. You can now proceed with frontend development or test the API endpoints using the provided documentation and test scripts.
Would you like me to help you with anything specific about the backend implementation or move on to frontend development?
